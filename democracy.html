    <h3>While most states in Ancient Greece were constantly under autocratic governments, Athens was an outlier. They invented the world's first
    republic, and you can see it! You might not recognise it as a democracy at first, though, for the government of Athens was fundamentally
    different in many ways: most notably, as opposed to our system of electing popular people into office, you can vote to banish the
    unpopular. This is a process called ostracism, and you can scratch any citizen's name on an ostraka, or scratched piece of pottery. Provided,
    of course, that you're a good citizens. Good citizens of Athens perform the duty of their class and follow the rules, and can participate
    in this democracy. These voters can also elect to the assembly (er, un-elect), a legislative body of Athens. But there's one catch:
    Aristocrats are almost always the ones in charge, meaning it's hard to rise through the ranks as a normal Athenian. Still better than
    Sparta!
