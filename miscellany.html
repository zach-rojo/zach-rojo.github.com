    <h3>The Ancient Greeks weren't exactly best friends. Far from that, very very far indeed. This... rivalry... resulted in many battles that
    killed many people, but these confrontations were also the cornerstones of our Western history. Many common tactics were developed
    on these very battlegrounds. Fortunes were gained and lost, heroes were made and destroyed, in these clashes of men versus men. We,
    back to the future tours, invite you to watch, or even take part in, any of these battles. PLEASE NOTE: BACK TO THE FUTURE TOURS LLC 
    IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS OF LIFE OR PROPERTY AS A RESULT OF ANY BATTLE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: GETTING SQUASHED
    BETWEEN TWO PHALANXES, SPEAR WOUNDS FROM PHALANXES, TRAMPLING BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S CAVALRY (Trained by none other than Phillip of
    Macedon), OR PERSIAN ARROWS (The persians fielded great archers.). <br>
        If participating in a battle doesn't sound right for you, then we invite you to see the Oracle of Delphi. According to Greek myth, the
    Oracle could see the events of fate before they happened. The Oracle is available, sometimes for a fee, and is always the current high
    priestess of the temple of Apollo.
