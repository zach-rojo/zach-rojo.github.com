    <h3>In Ancient Greece, everyone had a role, but some people were especially important and well-known to historians. These were the people
    who led the Greeks to their high achievements, fought battles, commanded countries, or just got lucky. Our number one celebrity pick
    for you to meet is Pericles, the leader of Athens for a long time, and the engineer of the worlds first democracy. All Greek city states
    had an autocratic government from the beginning. It was an easy way to maintain order and have a functioning state. But the people were
    never included very much in these governments. Pericles was a politician in Athens, first showing political prowess and being from a
    political family, but quickly demonstrated that he was different. Although democracy was technically already there in Athens, he solved
    many of the problems that the government faced trying to bring any real power to the people while still having a secure and functioning
    state. He died tragically during war with Sparta, another major city-state in Greece.
      The second pick for you to meet is Themistocles, an Athenian military commander. Greece was going through troublesome times in his 
    period: the mighty Persian Empire, dozens of times the size of the largest Greek city-state, invaded with an army of up to several hundred
    thousand warriors. When Persia sent its army off on Persia's underdeveloped fleet (they could've just crossed the Dardanelles strait
    from Anatolia to Thrace), he saw his opportunity, luring the Persian fleet into a narrow pass, and destroying it. Greece was saved from
    Persia, and his name goes down in history.
