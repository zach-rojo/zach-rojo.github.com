    <h3>The ancient Greeks' culture was developed by their geography. Greece was a mountain country, meaning that there were very few
      available lands for traditional fields. This meant that the Greeks lived mainly off what's known as the Mediterrainean triad: olives,
      grapes, and goats. As such, you'll probably find yourself eating all these foods commonly. Greece is also a peninsula, spanning into
      several other peninsulas, and many of the cultural centers, suck as Athems, are situated on the coast. Commerce bustles here, and
      you'll be sure to find foreigners in these areas. They have fewer rights than Greek citizens and can't usually own much property.
      Nevertheless, Greece still was one of the most foreigner-tolerant cultures, embracing new ideas that came from their exotic homelands.
      It's advisable to talk to some of these people, they'll tell you lots about the world at the time of Ancient Greece.
      Greeks believed in many gods, similar to the Roman gods, including 12 of the most important, who resided on mount Olympus.
      The largest monument to the gods is the massive temple of the Parthenon, dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom, in Athens, 
      which was called attica before making her the patron god of the city. Athens is an important cultural center for many other reasons,
      and we encourage you to inquire more on the other magnificent things you can see there. </h3>
