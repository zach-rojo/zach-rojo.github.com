    <h3>A lot of cool things happened in the history of Ancient Freece, but these are the ones we think you'll find most interesting:
    <br>    -The Delian League: Democratic Athens, at the height of its power, created a league of other city-states as a kind of early international
    bloc, like NATO or the Warsaw Pact, against Athens' main rival, Sparta. Although the Delian league was nominally a monetary union of
    equal states, Athens was the real power, and it held more than monetary influence in the other member-states. 
    <br>    -The building of the Colossus of Rhodes: Visitors to the Greek island of Rhodes (Aegean sea) will be in for quite a surprise,
    as they'll be greeted upon entering the port by a 108-foot statue, constructed entirely out of bronze! In one hand it holds a giant flame,
    and boats will have to pass between its legs. At this point it's advisory to <strong>NOT LOOK UP</strong>. Time is limited, it'll soon fall!
    <br>    -The construction of the Parthenon is considered a must-see, being one of the largest construction events in Greek history. Many
    thousands of workers laboured from dusk 'till dawn on this project, moving tens of thousands of pounds worth of rocks per load. Many died
    along the way, and maybe this is why, in the Greek hells, someone was sentenced to carry a large rock up a mountain, and he neve finished.
